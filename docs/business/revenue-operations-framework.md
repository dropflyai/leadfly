## 💡 Pricing Intelligence & Optimization

### **Competitive Pricing Intelligence**

#### **Real-Time Pricing Monitoring**
```javascript
const competitorPricing = {
  apollo: {
    basic: 39,
    professional: 79,
    organization: 119,
    last_updated: Date.now()
  },
  outreach: {
    sales_engagement: 100,
    sales_execution: 165,
    enterprise: 'custom',
    last_updated: Date.now()
  },
  zoominfo: {
    professional: 199,
    advanced: 299,
    elite: 'custom',
    last_updated: Date.now()
  }
}

// Automated pricing adjustment triggers
function monitorCompetitorPricing() {

  }
}
```

#### **Value-Based Pricing Justification**

**ROI Calculation Framework**:
```
Customer Investment Analysis:
Current Solution Cost: $X annually
Duplicate Lead Cost: $Y annually (40% of leads)

LeadFly AI Solution:
Software Cost: $1,788-$17,988 annually
Duplicate Savings: 99.2% × $Y = savings
Conversion Improvement: 3x higher = additional revenue
Total Value: Savings + Additional Revenue

Net ROI: (Total Value - Software Cost) / Software Cost
Target ROI: 300-700% annually
```

### **Dynamic Pricing Engine**

#### **Pricing Personalization**
```javascript
function calculatePersonalizedPrice(customer) {
  const basePrice = getBasePriceForTier(customer.tier);
  
  let priceModifier = 1.0;
  
  // Company size adjustment
  if (customer.company_size > 1000) priceModifier *= 1.2;
  if (customer.company_size < 50) priceModifier *= 0.9;
  
  // Industry adjustment
  const industryModifiers = {
    'technology': 1.1,
    'finance': 1.15,
    'healthcare': 1.05,
    'education': 0.85,
    'nonprofit': 0.7
  };
  priceModifier *= industryModifiers[customer.industry] || 1.0;
  
  // Urgency adjustment
  if (customer.evaluation_timeline < 30) priceModifier *= 1.05;
  
  // Competitive situation
  if (customer.competitive_alternatives.includes('apollo')) {
    priceModifier *= 0.95; // Slight discount to win
  }
  
  return Math.round(basePrice * priceModifier);
}
```
