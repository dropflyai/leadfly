## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. **Import Workflows**
1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to **Workflows** ‚Üí **Import from File**
3. Import each JSON file individually
4. Activate the workflows after configuration

### 2. **Environment Variables**
Configure these environment variables in n8n:

```bash
LEADFLY_API_URL=https://your-leadfly-domain.com
LEADFLY_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. **Credentials Setup**
Create these credentials in n8n:

#### **LeadFly API Auth** (HTTP Header Auth)
- **Name**: `leadfly-api-auth`
- **Header Name**: `Authorization`
- **Header Value**: `Bearer {{$env.LEADFLY_API_KEY}}`

### 4. **Webhook Configuration**
Configure your email providers to send webhooks to:

#### **SendGrid**
```
Webhook URL: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/leadfly/webhook/email-engagement
Events: delivered, open, click, bounce, unsubscribe, spamreport
HTTP Method: POST
```

#### **Mailgun**
```
Webhook URL: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/leadfly/webhook/email-engagement
Events: delivered, opened, clicked, unsubscribed, complained, bounced
```

#### **Postmark**
```
Webhook URL: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/leadfly/webhook/email-engagement
Events: Delivery, Open, Click, Bounce, SpamComplaint, Unsubscribe
```

### 5. **Lead Input Integration**
Send new leads to the qualification webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/leadfly/webhook/new-lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe", 
    "email": "john@company.com",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "title": "VP Sales",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "industry": "technology",
    "source": "apollo",
    "campaign_id": "camp_456"
  }'
```

## üîÑ Workflow Dependencies

The workflows work together in this sequence:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Lead] --> B[Lead Qualification Master]
    B --> C[Landing Page Created]
    B --> D[Email Sequence Started]
    D --> E[Email Engagement Processor]
    E --> F[Lead Scoring Update]
    F --> G[Warm Lead Call Scheduler]
    H[Task Queue Processor] --> I[All Automation Tasks]
```

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

The workflows include comprehensive monitoring:

### **Success Metrics**
- Task processing success rate (target: >95%)
- Lead qualification rate
- Email engagement rates
- Call scheduling efficiency

### **Alert Conditions**
- Task processing failures >10%
- Overdue tasks >10 items
- High-priority engagement events
- System performance issues

### **Notification Channels**
Configure these in the "Send Notifications" nodes:
- Slack webhooks
- Email alerts
- SMS notifications (Twilio)
- PagerDuty integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### **Scaling Configuration**
Adjust batch sizes in workflows:
- Task processor: 50 tasks per batch (recommended)
- Email processor: Process all events immediately
- Call scheduler: Check every 15 minutes

### **Timing Adjustments**
Modify cron expressions:
- Task processor: `0 */5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes)
- Call scheduler: `0 */15 * * * *` (every 15 minutes)
- Cleanup: `0 0 */6 * * *` (every 6 hours)

### **Error Handling**
Each workflow includes:
- Retry logic for failed tasks
- Error logging and notifications
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks

## üîí Security Notes

- All API calls use Bearer token authentication
- Webhook signatures are verified
- Sensitive data is not logged
- Rate limiting should be configured at infrastructure level

## üìà Performance Optimization

For high-volume usage:
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Run multiple n8n instances
2. **Database Optimization**: Use Redis for task queuing
3. **Webhook Batching**: Group events where possible
4. **Monitoring**: Set up detailed performance metrics

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Webhook timeouts**: Increase timeout values in HTTP Request nodes
2. **Rate limiting**: Add delay nodes between API calls
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce batch sizes or increase n8n memory
4. **Authentication errors**: Verify API keys and credentials

### **Debug Mode**
Enable debug mode in n8n settings to see detailed execution logs.

### **Health Checks**
Use the task processor's health check endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-leadfly-domain.com/api/automation/task-processor?action=health_check
```
